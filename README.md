## Identity Assertion W3C Verifiable Credential JSON Schema

The identity assertion verifiable credential must adhere to a set of strict requirements as depicted in the [Identity Assertion specification](https://creator-assertions.github.io/identity/1.0-draft/). All of these requirements are gathered in verifiable credentials [Data Schemas](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#data-schemas).

These data schemas schemas SHOULD be used to establish if the structure and contents of a verifiable credential conforms to all identity assertion verifiable credential requirements.

[Identity Assertion](https://creator-assertions.github.io/identity/1.0-draft/) offers JSON schemas as [Data Schemas](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#data-schemas) and all versions can be found in this repo.
